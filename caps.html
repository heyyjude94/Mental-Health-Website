 <center><p>Counselling and Psychological Services (CAPS) is the official mental health service at the University of Toronto. Alongside the peer support groups and workshops discussed elsewhere on this website, they also are connected to a number of other programs, for example, the Good 2 Talk Post-Secondary Student Helpline and the Counseline online counselling service. Finally, their most in-demand service is likely the short term professional counselling and psychiatric services they offer to students. Specific details on the types of counselling offered may be found here. In order to access these services, a student may be referred from a clinician at Health and Wellness or they may self-refer, either by calling in to (416)-978-8070 or by dropping in at the CAPS office on the first floor of the Koffler Student Service Center. At this point, the student will be scheduled for a brief phone evaluation within the next few days. The purpose of the phone evaluation is for the CAPS clinicians to make a diagnostic assessment; you will be asked a number of questions about your history of mental health and your current status. Subsequently, you will be contacted in order to schedule a meeting with a clinician based on their assessment. <br> <br>
The short term counselling offered is goal-oriented, aimed at learning skills to improve mental health and identifying obstacles that are proving detrimental and may be dealt with. CAPS is a very important service because it offers free counselling and psychiatric services to students under OHIP or their provincial insurance plan; for many people this kind of counselling is very important and productive, and, more importantly, it is conveniently located on campus and totally free. However, it’s worth noting something that is frequently brought up about CAPS -- the time it takes to get in and get an appointment can vary widely. As the sole provider of individual psychotherapy on campus for students, CAPS is very heavily requested, and many students report long wait-times between their phone evaluation and their first scheduled meeting with a clinician. Students whose mental health is proving physically detrimental to their health and putting either themselves or others at risk are quickly seen, but others frequently have to wait longer. <br> <br>
Students may also find that, as a provider of short term clinical mental health care, these individual counselling and psychological services are, on their own, insufficient to addressing larger, non-individual problems affecting their lives. For students belonging to marginalized communities, their mental health is sometimes affected by their experiences of marginalization. For such students, the resources listed in the Advocacy Groups and Safe Spaces sections of this website may be of use in addition to CAPS’ services.  <br>
CAPS also offers assault counselling and training. We hope to have a page on these services soon; for now, you can get more information here. <br>
CAPS is currently in a period of renovation, and they are hoping to improve on certain issues – the wait times, for example. We will update this page as needed to reflect new information about the service. <br> <br>
