 			 <p>The Centre for Women and Trans People serves primarily as a drop-in space for students who are women or trans-identified (trans men and women, genderqueer folks, non-binary folks, two-spirit individuals, and others) to hang out, meet, learn, and share experiences in a safe, anti-oppressive and communal environment. The Centre is committed to feminist, anti-racist, and anti-colonial ethics and practice. It hosts a peer support program for students and community members to discuss shared lived experiences relating to mental health, racism, transphobia, gender identity, body image, and self-care, among many other topics, and to offer support and solidarity. In addition, the Centre hosts many events and ongoing programs which may be of interest to students interested in learning about anti-oppressive activism, and also hosts a “Community Cupboard” and other food services aimed at members of the community in need, especially cis women and trans people. The Centre and all events it hosts are wheelchair accessible. <br> <br>

			<div id="drop4" data-dropdown-content class="large f-dropdown content">
 			 <p>First Nations House is where Aboriginal students from many nations across Canada can seek culturally appropriate services. <br>

Since 1992, the Office of Aboriginal Student Services and Programs has been supporting incoming and returning Aboriginal students, in all U of T programs. It provides students the opportunity to create a space where Aboriginal people from across Canada and the United States can work and grow in a community environment, which reflects the distinctive cultures of Aboriginal Nations. <br>
 
First Nations House is not only the home of Aboriginal U of T students, it is also a link to Toronto's Aboriginal community, allowing others in the university to learn and network. <br>

First Nations House assists Aboriginal students at the University of Toronto in a number of ways: <br>
Academic Support<br>
Financial Aid<br>
Events And Experience<br>
Resource Centre<br>
Student Groups<br>
Programs Of Interest<br>
<br>
First Nations House holds an orientation for new students annually.<br>
If you are new to the University of Toronto or if you have yet to visit First Nations House, stop by and learn about the supports we offer, meet new people, enjoy a cup of coffee, and find out the ways you can get involved in the Aboriginal community at U of T.
