 			 <p>	The Blue Space Committee is a new campaign that is promoting the awareness of mental health on campus. This campaign has a goal to break down and remove the stigma that is associated with mental health. <br><br>
“The word Blue was chosen for a few reasons, but a main reason was to challenge the term ‘feeling blue’ and its relationship with feeling down or sad.  A lot of people say that the colour blue also makes them feel calm, peaceful, or full of joy – which connects the different shades of blue to different feelings and emotions that are all a part of a person’s mental health. We want to have Blue Spaces across campus to invite all members of our community to feel welcome, to find support and to talk.  It’s a simple way to decrease the stigma related to mental health.”<br><br>
