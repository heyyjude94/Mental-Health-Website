 			 <p>“The grief support talking circle is a drop-in group for U of T students who are dealing with the death of a grandparent, parent, spouse/partner, sibling, friend as well as students experiencing anticipatory grief.  It is a small group of students sharing with and listening to each other talk about grief, loss, and coping with it in an academic setting. It is hoped that students feel less isolated, more connected and more supported by attending.” -Jeanette Unger <br><br>

 			 <p>
The Disordered Eating Support group is for students with disordered eating.  This is an opportunity to attend a group to help connect with others, have an opportunity to express and identify feelings and to explore some of the underlying issues.  This is not a treatment or intervention group or therapy, but it is a forum for students to share strategies and challenges of managing an eating disorder while being at school.
<br><br>
The content of the discussion is guided by the participants and is not set out in advance. As such, topics tend to vary from week to week. 
<br><br>
Participants say that it benefits them to know that there are others who are experiencing similar issues. It provides them with support and resources that may be helpful.
