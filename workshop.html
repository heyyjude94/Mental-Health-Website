                 Green Dot: Preventing Violence on our Campus <br>
A Green Dot is any action that reduces the risk of violence in the moment, supports survivors or creates a culture less tolerant of violence. A Green Dot is your individual choice to make our university safer.<br>
 
If you do your small part, and others do their small part, we can all make a difference in preventing power-based personal violence at U of T.<br><br>
Green Dot Bystander Training <br>
Green Dot is a six hour training that prepares you to recognize and be empowered to stand up against sexual, partner and stalking violence.  Many people know the difference between right and wrong, but how many people know how to respond in the short window of opportunity to help someone, and prevent power-based personal violence from happening. <br>
 With the Green Dot Training, you will be better able to:<br>
	* Learn about bystander intervention and create a safer community <br>
	* Be confident to address violence within your comfort zone <br>
	* Know of supports and resources on campus and community <br><br>
   
In addition to developing personal experience and competencies, you will receive a certificate that can be listed on your resume.<br>
There is no cost for the training and lunch will be included for the full day training.<br>

                 	Mindful monday holds meditation sessions for an hour on Mondays to help students on campus reduce stress they may be feeling. Their goal is to make people more aware of the present and to forget past mistake or future worries they may have. In these sessions people learn how to clear their mind and be surrounded by others who too want to reduce the stress in their life. This is especially important and useful for students who want to learn how to deal with stress when it comes to managing school work, assignments, exams or other daily chronic stresses. The sessions are run by the head coordinator Cheryl Champagne.  
When: Mondays 1:00 to 2:00 p.m. (March 3, 10, 17, 24 & 31)<br><br>

 			 <p>Are you ready to be inspired to get active and enjoy a healthy, happy campus life? We know you’re busy, but our MoveU team of staff and students is here to help you find opportunities on campus that will improve your sense of balance, add a little fun to your day and even improve your academic performance. Whether it’s yoga in your res room, a jog in the park, or a new dance class, adding a bit of movement to your day will improve the way you feel, think and learn. A break from your real work? No, it’s you at your most productive. <br><br>
 
We have reached close to 3500 students so far, and continue to reach more every day. The services we offer are used on a daily, weekly or monthly basis depending on the needs of the students. <br><br>

Our project is to create a website hub that would have direct links and brief information on the different services offered to UofT students that have to deal with physical and mental well being on campus.<br><br>

Our team is divided into three groups: Outreach and Communications, Events and Health Education. Each team has one or two team leads and up to 10 volunteers. We have a lead meeting once a week, and group meetings with volunteers once a week as well. We usually meet at the Athletic Centre. <br><br>
There is usually minimum wait time for services, however we prefer requests at least three weeks in advance so we can schedule our Movers accordingly.  <br><br>

Upcoming Events<br>
Aquatic Fun Day - March 20th, 2014<br>
Moveu Evaluation Study Day - March 25th, 2014<br>

More specific details on these upcoming events can be found on the Moveu Facebook Page!</p>

                 A growing body of scientific evidence shows that writing has positive effects on psychological health. This poet in community programme creates a space for creative self-expression. The programme uses poetry and writing as a way for students to explore their needs, passions and interests.Students use writing to connect the intellectual, the emotional, the physical and the social. NO experience is needed. Just walk in there feeling relaxed. Workshops are organized several times throughout the year. <br> <br>
.

Meeting times <br>
Usually there are four series with three workshops in each. All workshops are open to all students. Each workshop has a different theme like identity, relationships, power, connecting with others, and this new series is about balance. And in each workshop Ronna Bloom offer poems as prompts or jumping off places that people write from. This writing is completely private. There is an option to share but it is NEVER expected. Students have a chance to explore in this wide space where their personal lives and their academic lives meet. They get to write about all the parts of themselves that come to university: their humanity as well as their worries and their desires and their strivings. While it is not a support group, the support is simply being in a room with a bit of guidance, poetry, and the chance to write with other students exploring the same themes. <br><br>

Mindful Eating is a workshop geared to help students gain a better understanding of the effect food has on daily life. The goal for the workshops is to help students view food as a fuel for life, and understand its vitality to general quality of life. Through activities in the workshop, along with the assistance of a registered dietician, students learn to use Canada’s Food Guide as a nutritional tool to pace and plan their meals in order to improve their lifestyles, or simply change current ones. This workshops also focus on exercise and helps students come up with plans to integrate both exercise and healthy eating into their daily routines in a safe and communal space. Through the integration of informational sessions, dietary and exercise planning, and meditation, Mindful Eating primarily hopes to help students understand the significant role food plays on health, academic performance and general lifestyle.  <br><br>
